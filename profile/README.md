## Hey, this is us 👋

We are a Brazilian company that develops and contributes to Open Source projects. Our focus is security, so many of our creations and contributions aim to streamline some security process or address a flaw in an Open Source project.

> We believe that all software should be free, and we know that with the support of the community, this is possible!

Moreover, we would love to have your contribution to our projects, whether through an issue, a pull request, or sponsorship 😉.

> We're here to build a better world, one open-source code at a time.

### 🌱 Our creations.

In truth, it's selfish to say that they are ours because they belong to the community, and that's exactly how we want it. We initiate these projects, but we rely on community contributions to make them even better!

- [Avalia](https://github.com/hotaydev/avalia): System for science fairs evaluations management, created for Brazilian scientific fairs.
- [audit-export](https://www.npmjs.com/package/audit-export): An NPM package that is lightweight and works fully offline that exports the results of `npm audit` to an HTML file.
- [git-hook-creator](https://www.npmjs.com/package/git-hook-creator): A tool to easily create git hooks for NodeJS projects, simple as running `npx create-hook`.

We have great affection for everyone who contributes to the development of these projects 🫶🏼.
