## Hey, this is us 👋

We are a Brazilian company that develops and contributes to Open Source projects. Our focus is security, so many of our creations and contributions aim to streamline some security process or address a flaw in an Open Source project.

> We believe that all software should be free, and we know that with the support of the community, this is possible!

Moreover, we would love to have your contribution to our projects, whether through an issue, a pull request, or sponsorship 😉.

### 🌱 Our creations.

In truth, it's selfish to say that they are ours because they belong to the community, and that's exactly how we want it. We initiate these projects, but we rely on community contributions to make them even better!

- [enygmah](https://github.com/hotaydev/enygmah): Security and quality analysis tool for projects. It's easy to integrate and incredibly useful!
- [Useful Resources](https://github.com/hotaydev/hotaydev.github.io): Documentation for a set of tools and useful resources utilized by Hotay and shared with the community.
- The CLI: Automation tool for multiple environments in large projects, composed of various services. Still in internal development.

We have great affection for everyone who contributes to the development of these projects 🫶🏼.

### ⭐ Contributing

Do you want to contribute to our Open Source projects? That's great!! We admire your decision 🤩

You can participate in the projects listed in the previous topic, or if you prefer, sponsor our organization to continue giving its best for the Open Source community ❤️
