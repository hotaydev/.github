## Hey, this is us üëã

We are a Brazilian company that develops and contributes to Open Source projects. Our focus is quality, performance, and security, so many of our creations and contributions aim to improve these processes or address issues in Open Source projects.

> We believe that all software should be free, and we know that with the support of the community, this is possible!

Moreover, we would love your contribution to our projects, whether through an issue, a pull request, or sponsorship üòâ.

> We're here to build a better world, one open-source code at a time.

### üå± Our creations.

In truth, it's selfish to say they are ours because they belong to the community, and that's exactly how we want it. We initiate these projects, but we rely on community contributions to make them even better!

- [git-hook-creator](https://www.npmjs.com/package/git-hook-creator): A tool to easily create git hooks for NodeJS projects, as simple as running `npx create-hook`.
